Welcome to Montclair State University - Public University

Founded in 1908, Montclair has grown big enough to offer more than 300 programs across 13 colleges
and schools at all degree levels â€“ and yet, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17 to 1
is still small enough for students to receive personalized attention from professors and staff who truly care.
Students have numerous opportunities to conduct research with professors who are respected leaders in their fields.

Your Graduate Program - Computer Science (MS)

The program requires the completion of 30 credits.
